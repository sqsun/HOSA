Description: An approach to synergizing supervised clustering analysis via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and statistical inference on subgroup effects via Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Our proposed procedure, termed as Hybrid Operation for Subgroup Analysis (HOSA), enjoys computational speed and numerical stability with interpretability and reproducibility.
